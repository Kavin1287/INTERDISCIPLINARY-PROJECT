                    <p>Occupying an area of about 19 acre, this palatial mansion was once used as a prison by the
                        British for Mahatma Gandhi, Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadeo Desai, as well as Miraben, Pyarelal
                        Nair, Sarojini Naidu and Dr Sushila Nayar. Though imprisoned during the Quit India movement,
                        both Ba (as Kasturba Gandhi was fondly known) and Desai died of a heart attack in these
                        premises. Their memorials, made of marble, still stand here. With Italian architecture and
                        sculpted lawns, this grand building is now the headquarters of the Gandhi National Memorial
                        Society.

                        It was Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III who built this palace in 1892 as an act of charity for
                        those who were drastically affected by the famine that had hit Pune at the time. </p>

                    <p>The Pataleshwar Caves, also referred to as the Panchaleshvara temple or Bhamburde Pandav cave
                        temple, are an 8th century rock-cut Hindu temple from the Rashtrakuta period located in Pune,
                        Maharashtra, India. Dedicated to Shiva, it was a monumental monolithic excavation with a notable
                        circular Nandi mandapa and a large pillared mandapa. It is a temple of three rock-cut cave
                        sanctums, likely dedicated to Brahma-Shiva-Vishnu originally, but currently to Parvati-original
                        Shiva-Ganesha. A garden now surrounds the site, new idols have been placed elsewhere in the
                        complex. The interior of the caves have suffered damage from vandalism. Outside, the monument
                        shows the effects of natural elements over the centuries. </p>
