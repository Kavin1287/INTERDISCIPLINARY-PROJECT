        Pune is widely regarded to be the second major IT hub and the most important automobile and
        manufacturing hub in India. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, while on a visit to the city in the late '50s, was very
        impressed with Pune's many high-quality educational institutions and he is the one who gave the city the
        sobriquet of "the Oxford of the East". India's first indigenously run girls' school was started in
        Pune by Savitribai Phule. The city has emerged as a major global educational hub in recent decades, with nearly
        half of the total number of international students in the country studying in Pune. Research institutes
        of information technology, higher education, management science and advanced training attract students and
        professionals from India and overseas.
