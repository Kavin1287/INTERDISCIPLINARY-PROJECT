                    <p>A blog on city restaurants cannot go by without including Vaishali, one of the best veg
                        restaurants in Pune. The place is a legend when it comes to serving authentic South Indian food
                        that transports you instantly to the land of idli-sambar. Vaishali defies all logic when it
                        comes to peak hour rush, as more often than not, you are likely to find a huge waiting line at
                        the restaurant, even at 7 in the morning. For a Punekar, the place is a food Mecca and for the
                        vast student community of the city, it is god’s gift. This decades-old restaurant has its own
                        fan following, which swears by the taste and authenticity of its food.</p>

                    <p>The Punekars swear by this cafe and those from overseas also throng it from morning to night.
                        Off-late, the interiors of the good old bakery have been refurbished, but the essence of the
                        place has stayed intact even after so many years of it serving lip-smacking delicacies. Leaving
                        the bakery without getting their out-of-the-world Shrewsbury Biscuits packed, is almost
                        considered a blasphemy in Pune. It is always full and you can spend the waiting time ogling at
                        the sumptuous cakes and biscuits in the glass cabinets. German Bakery is almost a heritage spot
                        for Punekars and it has continued to be their favorite. There is outdoor seating on the ground
                        floor while the first floor of the bakery has indoor seating. The staff is courteous, the
                        service is efficient and quick, and the food is heavenly.
